_“The primary objective and foremost ideal for which Service League was organized is service to the community. Service means the efforts of each individual member to contribute of her time, skills, and abilities to further the growth and development of the cultural life of our community.”
-Hallie Fox Alvary, Founder_

LaPorte Service League formed in 1932 as a group of ladies who generously gave their time to the LaPorte community. Meetings were white glove affairs where tea and desserts where served while members coordinated service projects like administering a spoonful of castor oil to schoolchildren. LaPorte Service League also established and staffed libraries in area schools. The 1934 stage production of Cinderella established the tradition of bringing live theater to the children of LaPorte.

At one time meetings were scheduled after 8:00pm so mothers could tuck their children into bed before congregating at a member’s home. Over the years families have changed, and so has Service League. The membership is comprised of homemakers, mothers, doctors, accountants, engineers, and teachers. Despite the many time commitments of modern life, members give more than 50 hours of their time through projects that provide community assistance, reach out to area youth, and offer arts enrichment.

LaPorte Service League is unique in that service projects are specific to the talents and passions of the membership.

While some projects are funded with grants, others are supported by the sale of Port-a-Pit chicken and baked goods at the LaPorte Sunflower Fair. The annual Trivia Night is a fun night out with friends, and with its proceeds LPSL is able to award several scholarships to LaPorte High School graduates who demonstrate a passion for service to their community and plan to pursue their education in the arts.

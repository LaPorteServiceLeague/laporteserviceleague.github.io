LaPorte Service League is an organization dedicated to the community.

### Live Theater
Each January since 1934, members have acted, sewn costumes, constructed sets, and promoted a stage play for area schoolchildren. The cost per child remains just fifty cents, and teachers are given classroom activities related to the play to further enrich their experience.

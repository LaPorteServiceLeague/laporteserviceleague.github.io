LaPorte Service League is an organization dedicated to the community.

### Live Theater

Each January since 1934, members have acted, sewn costumes, constructed sets, and promoted a stage play for area schoolchildren. The cost per child remains just fifty cents, and teachers are given classroom activities related to the play to further enrich their experience.

### Scholarships

LaPorte Service League awards scholarships to LaPorte High School seniors who plan to pursue a college education in the arts. Award recipients demonstrate a commitment to service in their community, much like the honored members of Service League for which each scholarship is named.

    <h4>The Diane Bamberth Scholarship</h4>
    Diane was a member of La Porte Service League for many years. Her many hours of volunteer work in the community, the spirit with which she shared herself and her inspiration to many of us who worked with her has resulted in the naming of this scholarship in honor of her passing. The winner of this award is someone we feel has emulated Diane’s wonderful spirit of volunteering in our community and who is planning to major in a fine arts field in college.

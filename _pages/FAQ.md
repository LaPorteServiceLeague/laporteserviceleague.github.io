Thank you for your interest in attending LaPorte Service League’s annual play! We look forward to entertaining you! Below are Frequently Asked Questions about attending our annual play.

#### Can anyone see the play?

We perform for all! Weekday performances are traditionally attended by school groups with reservations. In 2014, nearly all weekday performances were sold out! We invite the public to our Very Important Premiere Performance Sunday, January 29th at 1pm, and our closing show on February 4th at 1pm.

#### How much does it cost?

A suggested donation of $.50 for children and $1.00 for adults is recommended.

#### How do I make a reservation for my group to see the play?

The reservation form can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/laporteserviceleague.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvxC-l67qeOcS_03jPFbozqMjMeyT2cpDNig_gKaac5sQsYA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">here</a>.

#### I made a reservation, now what?

You will receive an email confirmation of your reservation within two business days of submission. This will include an invoice that references the number of seats that you have reserved. In mid to late January you will receive an email indicating where your school group should be seated for the performance.

#### Who do I pay?

Payment for groups must be by check or money order written to LaPorte Service League and can be mailed to:

LaPorte Service League
P.O. Box 451
LaPorte, IN 46352

Please include a copy of your invoice in the envelope. Please postmark by January 28th. Cash donations at the auditorium are certainly welcome.

#### What do I do if members of my group need special accommodations?

Please indicate how we can accommodate your situation in the comments section of the reservation form. We will do everything in our power to assist!

The LaPorte High School is located at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/LaPorte+High+School/@41.601432,-86.726689,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xe54d4b8affc01950?sa=X&amp;ei=mfzLVJ2cC4KyyATN2IDgAg&amp;ved=0CH0Q_BIwDg" target="_blank">602 F Street, LaPorte, IN</a>. The auditorium is located on the southeast side of LaPorte High School facing F Street. Access from the main I Street entrance is NOT permitted.

#### How do I get there and where should I park?

All vehicles must use the parking lot on the northwest side of LaPorte High School. The entrance is on F Street. Buses may drop off at the auditorium door.

#### Where should we sit?

A chart of the auditorium indicating where your school group should be seated for the performance will be emailed to you one week before the performance week. Ushers will also be available to assist you upon your arrival.

#### What if the number of seats I need changes?

We understand that there may be unexpected absences or additions to your reservation. Email <a href="mailto:play@laporteserviceleague.com">play@laporteserviceleague.com</a> if your group’s total number will change by more than two seats.

#### What if the weather is questionable?

Because we are using the LaPorte High School facilities, we follow the LaPorte Community School Corporation decision to close or delay school due to weather. The status of school closure and delay can be found <a href="http://www.lpcsc.k12.in.us/closings.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. You can also consult local television and radio news for the decision.

#### My group was supposed to see the play and now school is closed. Now what?

If you indicated an alternate date and time in your reservation, we will contact you with confirmation of the new date and time. If your group is unable to reschedule, we hope that you will try again next year! We do not deposit your check until your group has attended the play. In the event that your group cannot attend, your check will be returned to you.
